# Integrations

The main goal of this section is to document integrations with differentes APIs / services / packages in order to not do them again in the future. The main structure of every integration should be:

- **Description**: describe the integrations purpose and link the official documentation.

- **Implementation**: link every code component / module / service in which you wrapped and used the integration. 

- **Pain Points**: document each of the main blockers when the integration was developed

- **Alternatives**: if known, add some alternatives to this servie

- **Estimation**: add the time in hours that it took to develop the integration, and a ballpark estimation in hours to implement it again using the linked code
