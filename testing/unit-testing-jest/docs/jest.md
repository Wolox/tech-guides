# Jest
Jest is a JavaScript test runner that helps us define tests in our code. Jest is not exclusive to Angular, Jest is for every JS framework. It is for this reason that we can find a lot of documentation about it. Also, Jest has a big community of developers.

Jest includes extensive options to configure the environment of tests. Like integrated coverage and command options. Also, Jest is very fast and we can spend less time developing our tests.
